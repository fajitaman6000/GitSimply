GitSimply is a lightweight, workflow-centric Git GUI built in Tkinter, designed for the solo developer, creative coder, or researcher.

Its core philosophy is to abstract away Git's complex command-line syntax and focus entirely on a simple, intuitive "snapshot and experiment" workflow. All work is done within a single project folder, which the tool manages seamlessly for IDEs like VSCode.

Key features include:
Effortless Experimentation: Treat versions as "experiments" (branches) that can be created and switched between with a single click.
Modal "Time Machine": Instead of just listing history, selecting a past snapshot enters a dedicated "Viewing the Past" mode, making it impossible to be confused about your current state.
Non-Destructive Restore: From the "time machine," you can restore any past state as a new snapshot in your current timeline, preserving all history and avoiding dangerous, destructive commands.
Branching from the Past: Instantly create a completely new experiment that begins from any point in another experiment's history.
Ultimately, it acts as a "Save Game" system for code, prioritizing rapid, safe iteration over the full, complex feature set of an enterprise-level version control tool.
